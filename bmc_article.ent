Even
though
there
are
other
techniques
in
topic
detection,
as
for
instance
LDA
(Latent
Dirichlet
Allocation),
the
NMF
decomposition
suites
perfect
for
the
kind
of
corpus
we
have
analyzed
in
this
work
(A
detailed
comparison
of
both,
NMF
and
LDA
methods
could
be
found
in
\textbf
{Supplementary
Material}).
